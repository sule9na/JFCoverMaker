# Jellyfin Cover Maker
A simple to use thumbnail cover maker, so you can create beautiful images for your home screen media libraries.

## Quick Start
The project is a simple HTML, CSS, Js bundle that you can on a local web server, if you so choose. For ease of use it's recommended to just use the published version of the tool here:

## Usage
The tool will create an image for you that can be exported and used as a thumbnail.

* IMAGE - First upload your image, it doesn't have to be a 16x9 ratio as you can resize it with the provided slider but an image that's wider than it is tall is helpful.
* IMAGE SIZING -Drag the image on the right panel to position it as you wish and fill the area as a background.
* DARKENING - You can then darken your image to allow the foreground text to stand out or to ensure equal brightness across all your media library thumbs. Just drag the slider to darken.
* TEXT - Next you can choose your font, size it and change the text that is in front of the image. You can also apply text styling to embolden or italicize the font.
* OVERLAY - The overlay is the color that overlays the image and allows the font to stand out. There are several options for this:
    * Start by picking your overlay type. You can use various shapes and directions of gradient or a total colour fill to overlay your image with color and differentiate your libraries.
    * Next you can set the opacity of that overlay.
    * If it's a gradient overlay you can also set the size of it.
    * Finally the glow amount and glow lightness will allow you to configure the outer glow on your text to make it stand out or blend in with the overlay.

### Exporting
Once you've configured your image as you like it just hit the export button to download the final output of your edit and review it.

## Best Usage
To set up a whole set of library images I'd recommend.
* Get one image in.
* Configure everything until you get a look you like.
* Once all the settings and sliders are configured well, export your first item, then:
    * Import a new image
    * Change the color
    * Change the title
    * Export again

This way you end up with multiple library images that are all set up with the same look, but with custom images, colours and text.
